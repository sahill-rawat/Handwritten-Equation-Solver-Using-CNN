# Handwritten-Equation-Solver-Using-CNN

1) Run the Data_extraction.py first to preprocess the data. For that you need to download the dataset (link in at the bottom).
After running code a csv file will be created which will be used in the next step.

2) In this step using the csv file which was created in the last step run train.py to train our CNN.

3) Now with the CNN test.py you can solve the eqautions. :)
